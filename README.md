# CNN-Optimizing-Local-eGPU
This is a great tutorial from towardsdatascience.com(https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-using-gpu-on-your-macbook-c9becba7c43) which allowed me to train and test a dataset from MNIST.  Despite the challenges with using eGPUs and the Mac OS, it also enabled me to verify that my local deep learning pipeline works with both plaidML (https://plaidml.github.io/plaidml/docs/install#macos) and my Radeon card.
